Math routines by Jean-Pierre Moreau

This repository is intended to preserve the mathematics library by Jean-Pierre Moreau (https://web.archive.org/web/20231002075104/https://jean-pierre.moreau.pagesperso-orange.fr/pascal.html). The library covers

* Arithmetic problems
* Evaluation of Bessel Functions
* Roots in the Complex Domain
* Differential equations
* Functional approximations by Iteration & Recursion
* Special Functions
* Geometry programs
* Graphic programs
* Least squares approximation
* Linear Programming
* Algorithms concerning matrices
* Programs concerning Mechanics
* Miscellaneous Programs
* Operations on Polynomials
* Roots of real functions
* Series approximation techniques
* Signal processing
* Sorting
* Statistics
* Utility procedures for graphics

The original Pascal library was written for Turbo Pascal and Turbo Pascal for Windows (folder "original"). It is attempted here to port the sources to FreePascal/Lazarus and modernize them where needed (folder "fpc").
