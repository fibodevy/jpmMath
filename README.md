Math routines by Jean-Pierre Moreau

This repository is intended to preserve the mathematics library by Jean-Pierre Moreau (https://web.archive.org/web/20231002075104/https://jean-pierre.moreau.pagesperso-orange.fr/pascal.html). The library covers

* Arithmetic problems
* Evaluation of Bessel Functions
* Roots in the Complex Domain
* Differential equations
* Functional approximations by Iteration & Recursion
* Special Functions
* Geometry programs
* Graphic programs
* Least squares approximation
* Linear Programming
* Algorithms concerning matrices
* Programs concerning Mechanics
* Miscellaneous Programs
* Operations on Polynomials
* Roots of real functions
* Series approximation techniques
* Signal processing
* Sorting
* Statistics
* Utility procedures for graphics

The original Pascal library was written for Turbo Pascal and Turbo Pascal for Windows (folder "original"). It is attempted here to port the sources to FreePascal/Lazarus and modernize them where needed (folder "fpc").

The original author does not specify any conditions how his code can be used. After inquiry about this (https://www.lazarusforum.de/viewtopic.php?p=150255#p150255), his son responded in a mail:

```
Hello,

My father, now very old, who created this website to capitalize and share his passion for
developing numerical computing algorithms, would be very happy if his work could benefit other people.

You can recover and reuse his work with great pleasure.

Kind regards,
Fran√ßois-Xavier Moreau ```
