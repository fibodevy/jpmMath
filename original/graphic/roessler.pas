* TUTORIAL:                                                                 *
*                                                                           *
*  Until recently, the only known attractors were the fixed point, the      *
*  limit cycle and the torus. In 1963, Edwards Lorenz, meteorologist at the *
*  M.I.T.,discovered a practical example of a simple dynamic system presen- *
*  ting a complex behaviour. To adapt them to computers available at that   *
*  time, he began with simplifying the equations of met√©orology to obtain   *
*  finally a model composed of three differential equations with three      *
*  unknown variables x, y, z and three parameters a, b, c:                  *
*                                                                           *
*         dx / dt = - a x + a y                                             *
*		  dy / dt = b x - y - x z                                           *
*		  dz / dt = -c z + x y                                              *
*                                                                           *
*  During very long simulations on a computer, Lorentz decided, to check a  *
*  result, to restart the same calculation halfway in order to spare time.  *
*  For that, he reinjected into the computer the intermediate date obtaine  *
*  earlier. He was very surprised to see that the new results were comple-  *
*  tely different from the first ones. After he suspected some computer     *
*  failure, Lorenz understood at last that the big difference between both  *
*  solutions came from very small differences in data. These small pertur-  *
*  bations exponentially amplified themselves, being doubled every four     *
*  days in simulated time, so after two months the results became entirely  *
*  different !                                                              *
*                                                                           *
*  Lorenz then realized that it would be very difficult to make meteorolo-  *
*  gical foresights in the long term, the slightest change in initial con-  *
*  ditions leading to a radically different evolution of atmosphere.        *
*                                                                           *
*  This is still the case today with atmospheric models much more sophis-   *
*  ticated.                                                                 *
*                                                                           *
*  None of the three attractors known at the time could predict the beha-   *
*  viour of such a dynamic system. Lorenz had just discovered a strange or  *
*  "chaotic" attractor to which his name was given, see program lorentz.pas *
*                                                                           *
*  The Roessler attractor is similar to the Lorenz attractor, by taking the *
*  following differential system of equations:                              *
*                                                                           *
*		  dx / dt = -( y + z )                                              *
*		  dy / dt = x + ( y / 5 )                                           *
*		  dz / dt = 1/5 + z ( x - 5,7 )                                     *
*                                                                           *
