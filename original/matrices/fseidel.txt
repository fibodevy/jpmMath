    Iterative Methods for Linear Systems A.x = B
    --------------------------------------------


    A Relaxation Method using the Gauss-Seidel Method
    -------------------------------------------------

    1. Introduction
       ------------

    The Gauss-Seidel iteration differs from the Jacobi iterations only slightly,
                                st
  for in it the calculated (v+1)   approximations of the leading coefficients
                        v                                    st
  x1, x2, ..., x    of x  are used when calculating the (v+1)   approximation of
                i-1
  x . For this method, the iteration rule becomes:
   i
       (v+1)      (v)     (v+1)
      x      = Brx   + Blx     + c

  with        | 0  b12 b13 ... b1n     |
              | 0  0 ...               |
         Br = | ---------------------- |
              | 0  0 ...       b n-1,n |
              | 0  0 ...       0       |

                                                        (5.11)
  and         | 0    0 ...     0       |
              | b21  ...               |
         Bl = | ---------------------- |
              | bn1  bn2 ...   b n,n-1 |

  and                          | -a  /a   for i<>k
         c  = a / a  ,  b   =  |   ik  ii
          i    i   ii    ik    |
                               |  0  for i=k

  Written out componentwise for i = 1, ... , n and v = 0, 1,2, ... we have:

          (v+1)          n       (v)   i-1     (v+1)
         x      = c  +  Sum  b  x    + Sum b  x          (5.12)
          i        i   k=i+1  ik k     k=1  ik k

                  bi      n   aik  (v)   i-1 aik  (v+1)
                = --- -  Sum  --- x    - Sum --- x
                  aii   k=i+1 aii  k     k=1 aii  k


    The following convergence criteria insure convergence for the Gauss-Seidel
  method:

    1) the row sum criterion: 

                    n                       n   |aik|
       max         Sum |b  | = max         Sum  |---| <= L    < 1  or
          1<=i<=n  k=1   ik       1<=i<=n  k=1  |aii|     inf
                                           k<>i

    2) the column sum criterion:

                    n                       n   |aik|
       max         Sum |b  | = max         Sum  |---| <= L    < 1  or
          1<=k<=n  i=1   ik       1<=k<=n  i=1  |aii|     1
                                           i<>k
                                   T
    3) if A is positive definite (x  Ax > 0 for all x <> 0), then the Gauss-
       Seidel method converges. 

  It is helpful to visualize the calculations in a scheme of the following form:

       ---------------------------------------------------------------------


    2. Iteration Rule
       --------------

    Given the linear system A.x = B, so the iteration rule for the Gauss-Seidel
  method is

       (v+1)      (v)     (v+1)
      x      = Brx   + Blx     + c       for v = 0,1,2...

    We can rewrite this as

          (v+1)    (v)    (v)
      |  x      = x    + z     for
      |   (v)             (v+1)            (v)              (5.17)
      |  z      = c + Bl x     - (I - Br) x   ,

  where Br and Bl denote the triangular matrices in (5.11).

                                           (v)      (v) 
    If one replaces the correction vector z    by wz    in (5.17) for a relaxa-
  tion coefficient w, then one obtains the iteration rule for the method of
  "successive relaxation":

       (v+1)    (v)            (v+1)            (v)
      x      = x    + w [c + Blx      - (I - Br)x  ]        (5.18)

    The calculation of an optimum value for w is difficult. It is possible to
  prove that the relaxation method (5.18) can only converge if 0 < w < 2.

    The optimum correlation factor for the "successive overrelaxation method",
  abbreviated customarily as "SOR method" is

                                          2
                          w    = -------------------2
                           opt   1 + sqrt(1 - lambda )
                                                    1

  for a linear system with a positive definite, tridiagonal or block tridiagonal
  matrix, A. Here lambda  is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix B  + B .
                        1                                          l    r

  Matrices of this kind appear naturally in discretizations of elliptic boundary
  value problems. ln this case the SOR method converges much faster with Wopt
  than a relaxation method with Jacobi's method. 

  3. Estimate for the Optimal Relaxation Coefficient, an Adaptive SOR Method
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   
    In order to speed up the method, at first a certain number l of steps
  ( l >= 1) is performed using the GauJ3-Seidel method for a fixed relaxation
  coefficient w. Then the near optimal relaxation coefficient is obtained from: 


  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                SOR ALGORITHM
                                -------------
     
    Given: Ax = b, where A satisfies the hypothesis for the GauJ3-Seidel method
    and we assume that all eigenvalues of the iteration matrix B are real. 

    Find: approximate solution x. 

    Set: w := 1, q := 1, v := O. 

    Choose: accuracy bound eps real, eps > 0, 
            number of steps l between adjustments for the relaxation parameter;
            integer l >= 1. 
            starting vector x(O).
 
  For each v = 0,1,2,... perform the following steps:

              (v+1) 
  1. Compute x     according to (5.18). If v is an integer multiple of l, conti-
     nue with step 2, otherwise go to step 3.
      
  2. To adjust the relaxation coefficient compute

                       (v+1)    (v)
                    |xk     - xk   |
            q = max ---------------- 
                 k     (v)    (v-1)
                    |xk   - xk     |

     if q > 1, raise v by 1 and go to step 1; otherwise set

            q = max (q, w-1)

     and compute the new approximate relaxation coefficient as:

                           2
            w = --------------------------
                             1 ( q+w-1 ) 2
                1 + sqrt(1 - - (-------) 
                             q (   w   )

  3. If        (v+1)   (v)                     (v+1)
            ||x     - x   ||    <= eps(1-q) ||x     ||    ,
                            inf                       inf
                                   (v+1
     stop the iteration with x == x    ; otherwise set v=v+1 and continue with
     step 1.
