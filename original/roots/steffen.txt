  Aitken-Steffenson Iteration
  ---------------------------

    Aitken-Steffenson iteration is a variation on the Aitken acceleration sche-
  me. lt has very good convergence properties (quadratic) if the initial guess
  is in the vicinity of the root. This is to be contrasted with some of the al-
  gorithms discussed earlier which can diverge even if the initial guess is ve-
  ry close to the root. 

    As with Aitken acceleration (see file aitken.txt), this method is designed
  to find the fixed points of x = g(x). If we again define g(x) = x + cy(x),
  then the Aitken-Steffenson iteration formula is

                                 [g(xn) - xn]Â²
                  x'n = xn - ----------------------          (6.12.1)
                             g[g(xn)] - 2g(xn) + xn 

  x'n is employed to directly calculate xn+l using xn+l = g(x'n). This procedure
  differs from that of the Aitken acceleration algorithm which requires three
  prior values in order to perform the acceleration calculation. 

    The Aitken-Steffenson iteration scheme is applied in program Steffen. The
  results of using this subroutine to find the roots associated with the three
  following equations are shown below. 

            A) y(x) = x - 2 sin x               initial guess x0 = pi/2 
            B) y(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - X - 2        initial guess x0 = -1.5
            C) y(x) = sin x                     initial guess x0 = 20

    If we use these examples as a guide, and compare them to the results of file
  Aitken.txt, we will see that Aitken-Steffenson iteration appears to behave
  much the same as Aitken acceleration. But it is somewhat slower in convergence
  --more iterations are required. ln 12 of the 60 examples, the iteration did
  not termina te at a11, probably because of round-off error problems in the
  calculation. 

    As with Aitken acceleration, convergence can be slow if the chosen c is too 
  small. Also, jumps can occur if c is too large and/or of the wrong sign (see
  example (A) for the case E = 0.0000001, c = 1). 

    Convergence can also be poor if |dg/dx| == 1 near the root. Because the de- 
  rivative of g(x) is 
                                              c
                                dg/dx = 1 + -----
                                            dy/dx

  poor convergence can occur if dy/dx == O. Geometrica11y, this result is not
  surprising.
   
    Even with these limitations, Aitken-Steffenson iteration and its relative,
  Aitken acceleration, are perhaps among the most powerful of the simple root-
  finding techniques available.
