## General Usage Notes

*   **Programming Language**: All components of the `jpmMath` library are implemented in **Turbo Pascal** or **Borland Pascal for Windows**. (In an on-going activity, routines are being be ported to modern **Free Pascal** - see folder `fpc`).
*   **Data Types**: The library primarily utilizes `DOUBLE` (aliased as `REAL_AR` in many units) for floating-point numbers to ensure high precision in numerical computations. Integers (`INTEGER`, `LONGINT`) are used for degrees, counts, and indices.
*   **Input/Output**: Most programs interact with the user via the console for input and display results directly to the console. Some advanced modules, particularly those handling large datasets or providing graphical output, may read from structured text files (e.g., `.dat` files) and write comprehensive reports to output files (e.g., `.lst` or `.txt` files).
*   **Global Variables**: Many procedures and functions within the library's units frequently use global variables for inputs, outputs, and internal state. When integrating these routines into larger applications, users should be aware of this scope and manage variable assignments carefully to avoid unintended side effects.
*   **Numerical Accuracy and Error Handling**: The documentation for individual modules (and inline code comments) often discusses the numerical accuracy, stability characteristics, and potential error conditions for each algorithm. Return codes (e.g., `0` for success, non-zero for specific error types) are commonly used for robust error handling. Users are encouraged to consult these notes to understand appropriate use cases and limitations.
*   **Modularity**: The library is designed with modularity in mind. Many complex algorithms are broken down into smaller, reusable procedures and functions encapsulated within Pascal `UNIT`s. This allows developers to import and utilize specific functionalities without needing to understand the entire codebase.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions aimed at improving the clarity, robustness, or extending the functionality of this library are welcome. When contributing:

*   **Documentation Focus**: All new or modified code should be thoroughly documented, following the existing style of explanatory files (`.txt` or markdown) and inline comments in `.pas` files.
*   **Technical Language**: Maintain a technical and precise language, avoiding commercial jargon or promotional statements.
*   **Focus on Existing Features**: Ensure documentation solely reflects currently implemented features. Avoid documenting future or "to-be-developed" functionalities.
*   **Referenced Files/Functions**: Verify that all references to files, procedures, and functions within documentation accurately reflect their existence and naming in the codebase to prevent broken links or misleading information.
*   **Educational Value**: Consider how contributions can help future developers understand the mathematical and computational aspects of the methods, fostering a deeper understanding.
*   **Code Structure**: While some duplication of utility functions exists for demonstration purposes, consider proposing consolidation into shared units (e.g., Pascal `unit` files) for larger enhancements, if appropriate for Pascal.
