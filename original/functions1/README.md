### Interpolation

Interpolation methods are used to estimate values between known data points. This library offers various techniques for different interpolation requirements.

*   **Akima Spline Fitting**
    *   **Files:** `akima.pas`, `akima.txt`
    *   **Description:** Implements Akima's cubic interpolation technique, which approximates the properties of a natural spline. It is faster than exact spline interpolation algorithms as it avoids time- and memory-consuming matrix operations. This method is particularly effective for smoothing curves and handling data with discontinuities, as it tends to minimize net curvature, preventing excessive "kinks" in the interpolated curve.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `Interpol_Akima` procedure is designed to interpolate values within a table of discrete points.
        *   **Procedure:** `Interpol_Akima` (within `akima.pas`)
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `X`: `Array` of `double` (table x-values, assumed to be in ascending order).
            *   `Y`: `Array` of `double` (table y-values).
            *   `XX`: `double` (the interpolation point).
            *   `IV`: `INTEGER` (the total number of points in the `X` and `Y` tables).
        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `YY`: `double` (the interpolated value at `XX`).
            *   `N`: `INTEGER` (an error flag; `0` indicates an error, typically if `XX` is outside the allowable table range, which requires at least one table value to the left and three to the right of `XX`).
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Data Smoothing:** Useful in signal processing to smooth noisy sensor data (e.g., temperature, pressure, or motion sensor readings) without introducing artificial oscillations.
        *   **Computer Graphics & CAD/CAM:** Generating smooth curves for rendering 2D or 3D models from a limited set of control points. This is crucial in designing aesthetically pleasing and functionally continuous surfaces for automotive bodies, aircraft wings, or product designs.
        *   **Robotics:** Creating smooth and continuous trajectory paths for robotic arms or autonomous vehicles. This ensures fluid movement, minimizes wear on mechanical components, and allows for precise control.
    *   **Notes:** While generally robust, Akima's method can sometimes suffer from round-off errors compared to methods like Lagrange interpolation. However, it often provides better behavior for discontinuous functions, producing a smoother fit than Newton's method in such scenarios.

*   **Chebyshev Polynomial Approximation**
    *   **Files:** `chebyshe.pas`, `chebyshe.txt`, `tchebysh.pas`, `tchebint.pas`, `tchebde.pas`
    *   **Description:** Implements Chebyshev polynomial approximation using Chebyshev coefficients. This method is known for yielding a "minimax" polynomial, which minimizes the maximum deviation from the true function over a specified interval. It's particularly useful for approximating functions when a highly accurate and numerically stable polynomial representation is needed. The unit also includes routines for integrating and differentiating Chebyshev series.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `Chebyshe` unit provides several routines for approximation, evaluation, integration, and differentiation using Chebyshev polynomials.
        *   `CHEBFT(A, B: Double; Var C: Tab; N: Integer)`: Computes the Chebyshev coefficients `Ck` for a function `FUNC(X)` over an interval `[A,B]`. The approximation is exact at the `N` zeros of `TN(X)`.
        *   `CHEBEV(A, B: Double; C: Tab; M: Integer; X: Double): Double`: Evaluates the Chebyshev polynomial at a given point `X` using the computed coefficients `C` (of length `M`).
        *   `CHINT(A, B: Double; C: Tab; Var CINT: Tab; N: Integer)`: Computes the Chebyshev coefficients (`CINT`) of the integral of a function whose coefficients are `C`. The constant of integration is set so that the integral vanishes at `A`.
        *   `CHDER(A, B: Double; C: Tab; Var CDER: Tab; N: Integer)`: Computes the Chebyshev coefficients (`CDER`) of the derivative of a function whose coefficients are `C`.
        *   `FUNC(x:Double): Double`: A user-defined function (within `chebyshe.pas`) that needs to be approximated.
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Numerical Libraries:** Building highly accurate and efficient approximations for transcendental functions (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `log`) in scientific computing libraries, ensuring uniform approximation error.
        *   **Data Compression:** Representing complex data curves with a smaller set of coefficients for efficient storage and transmission, especially in scientific data analysis.
        *   **Digital Signal Processing:** Designing optimal digital filters or approximating complex signals where uniform approximation error across a frequency band is desired.
    *   **Notes:** The approximation can be truncated to a lower degree `m << N` to yield a very accurate polynomial of degree `m`. `tchebysh.pas` demonstrates approximation, `tchebint.pas` demonstrates integration, and `tchebde.pas` demonstrates differentiation.

*   **Continuous Fractions Interpolation**
    *   **Files:** `confract.pas`, `confract.txt`

    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `Confract` program interpolates a function `F(x)` that passes through `N+1` given points `(xi, f(xi))`. It calculates coefficients based on an inverse divided differences formula and then evaluates the continuous fraction.
        *   **Program:** `Confract`

            *   `Y[K]`: `Array` of `double` (y-coordinates of the `N1` points).
            *   `XX`: `double` (The interpolation point).
        *   **Outputs:**

        *   **Signal Processing:** Enhancing signal reconstruction from discrete samples, particularly in scenarios where the underlying signal has sharp changes or asymptotic behavior.
        *   **Control Systems:** Designing controllers that require accurate and stable function approximations over a wide range, even with complex system dynamics.

    *   **Description:** Implements Lagrange polynomial interpolation, which constructs a unique polynomial of degree `N` that passes through `N+1` given data points. It is straightforward to program due to its repetitive structure, and it can handle arbitrarily spaced independent variables.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `Interpol_Lagrange` procedure interpolates data points `(X(I), Y(I))` for a given interpolation point `XX` and a specified degree `N`.
        *   **Procedure:** `Interpol_Lagrange` (within `lagrange.pas`)

        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `YY`: `double` (the interpolated value).
            *   `N`: `INTEGER` (an error flag; `0` implies an error, e.g., `XX` is outside the allowed range (`X[1] <= XX <= X[IV-N]`) or `X(I)` are not distinct/ordered).
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Scientific Experimentation:** Estimating values of physical quantities at unmeasured points based on a set of experimental observations, such as temperature between sensors or pressure in a fluid.

It provides an error estimate based on the next term in the Taylor series expansion. The implementation calculates cubic interpolation.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `Interpol_Newton` procedure calculates cubic interpolation for a given table `(X(I), Y(I))` at an interpolation point `XX`.
        *   **Procedure:** `Interpol_Newton` (within `newton.pas`)
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `X`: `Tab` (Array of `double`) (table x-values, must be in ascending order).

            *   `E`: `double` (the error estimate based on the next term in the expansion).
            *   `N`: `INTEGER` (an error flag; `0` implies an error, e.g., `XX` is outside the allowed range `X[1]` to `X[IV-3]` for cubic interpolation).
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Numerical Analysis Education:** A classic method for demonstrating polynomial interpolation and understanding error propagation in numerical algorithms.
        *   **Data Analysis:** When an error estimate is desirable alongside the interpolated value, for example, in quality control systems or financial risk assessments.
        *   **Computational Physics:** Approximating physical phenomena from discrete measurements, where the behavior between points is assumed to be polynomial, such as particle trajectories.
    *   **Notes:** While mathematically equivalent to Lagrange, Newton's method can be more susceptible to round-off error, especially when dealing with closely spaced points or extending to higher orders.

    *   **Files:** `tpolint.pas`
    *   **Description:** Provides a general procedure for polynomial interpolation or extrapolation of a discrete function `F(x)`. It uses an algorithm that iteratively updates approximations, offering an estimated error `DY` along with the interpolated value `Y`.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `POLINT` procedure estimates `Y` for a given `X` based on a table of `N` points `(XA, YA)`. It can be used for both interpolation (within the range of `XA`) and extrapolation (outside the range of `XA`).

*   **Rational Function Interpolation/Extrapolation**
    *   **Files:** `tratint.pas`
    *   **Description:** Implements interpolation or extrapolation using a quotient of polynomials (rational function).

    *   **Purpose & Usage:**
        *   The `SPLINE` procedure calculates the coefficients for the cubic spline based on input data points.
        *   The `SEVAL` function then evaluates the spline at a given abscissa `U` using these computed coefficients.

        *   **Oceanography:** Modeling natural periodic phenomena like tides, ocean currents, or seasonal temperature variations.
    *   **Notes:** The program uses a method for calculating coefficients that is conceptually related to the Discrete Fourier Transform.

### Differentiation

        *   **Machine Learning (Feature Engineering):** Creating new features from time-series data that represent rates of change or acceleration, which can be useful for predictive models.
    *   **Notes:** The accuracy of the derivative estimation depends on the data spacing and the order of interpolation. Higher orders can introduce more round-off error, especially with noisy data.

*   **Nth Derivative Estimation**
    *   **Files:** `nderiv.pas`
    *   **Description:** Estimates the Nth derivative (for N=1 to 5) of a real function `f(x)` at a point `x` with a given step size `h`. This utility is useful for numerical differentiation when an analytical form of the derivative is difficult to obtain or when verifying analytical results.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `ar_nderiv` function computes `f^(n)(x)` where `n` is the order of the derivative (1 to 5). The function `f(x)` to be differentiated must be defined within the program.
        *   **Function:** `ar_nderiv(x: double; n: integer; h: double): Double`

            *   `ar_nderiv`: `double` (the estimated Nth derivative).
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Sensitivity Analysis:** Quantifying how sensitive a system's output is to changes in its inputs (e.g., in engineering design, economic modeling, or pharmaceutical development).
        *   **Curve Fitting Diagnostics:** Assessing the smoothness of a fitted curve by numerically examining its derivatives to detect anomalies or overfitting.
        *   **Physics Simulations:** Approximating accelerations (second derivative of position) or higher-order rates of change from discrete or continuous function models.
    *   **Notes:** The choice of `h` is critical for accuracy; for polynomial functions, a larger `h` (e.g., `h=1`) can sometimes yield better results than a very small `h` (e.g., `h=0.01`) due to floating-point precision issues and the specific finite difference formulas used.

*   **Romberg Method for First Derivative**
    *   **Files:** `difrom.pas`, `tdifrom.pas`
    *   **Description:** Computes an approximation for the first derivative of a function `func(x)` using the Romberg method.

### Optimization

Optimization routines are designed to find the maximum or minimum of a function, which can be in one or multiple dimensions.

*   **Bracketing a Minimum**
    *   **Files:** `mnbrak.pas`
    *   **Description:** The `MNBRAK` subroutine is used to find three points (`AX`, `BX`, `CX`) that bracket a minimum of a real function `FUNC(X)`. Given two distinct initial points `AX` and `BX`, it searches in the downhill direction to ensure `BX` is between `AX` and `CX`, and `FUNC(BX)` is less than both `FUNC(AX)` and `FUNC(CX)`. This procedure is a prerequisite for more sophisticated minimization algorithms.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `MNBRAK` procedure provides an initial interval for more sophisticated minimization algorithms like Golden Section Search or Brent's method. The function `FUNC(X)` to be minimized must be defined within the program.
        *   **Procedure:** `MNBRAK(AX, BX: DOUBLE; VAR CX, FA, FB, FC: DOUBLE)`
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `AX`: `DOUBLE` (First initial point).
            *   `BX`: `DOUBLE` (Second initial point, distinct from `AX`).
            *   `FUNC(X): DOUBLE` (User-defined function to minimize).
        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `AX`, `BX`, `CX`: `DOUBLE` (Three points that bracket the minimum, with `BX` between `AX` and `CX`).
            *   `FA`, `FB`, `FC`: `DOUBLE` (The function values at `AX`, `BX`, `CX` respectively, with `FB < FA` and `FB < FC`).
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Algorithm Preprocessing:** Often a necessary first step for many one-dimensional optimization algorithms, ensuring that the search for a minimum starts within a guaranteed interval.
        *   **Model Calibration:** Identifying a likely range for a parameter that minimizes an error function in scientific or engineering models.
        *   **Engineering Design:** Narrowing down the search space for optimal design parameters in a robust manner.
    *   **Notes:** Uses `GOLD` (golden ratio constant `1.618034`) for interval magnification and `GLIMIT` (`100.0`) for maximum allowed magnification, along with a `TINY` constant (`1E-20`) to prevent division by zero.

        *   **Function:** `GOLDEN(AX, BX, CX, TOL: DOUBLE; VAR XMIN: DOUBLE): DOUBLE`
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `AX`, `BX`, `CX`: `DOUBLE` (The bracketing triplet of abscissas, such that `BX` is between `AX` and `CX`, and `F(BX)` is less than `F(AX)` and `F(CX)`).
            *   `TOL`: `DOUBLE` (The desired fractional precision for the minimum's location).
            *   `F(X): DOUBLE` (User-defined function to minimize).
        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `XMIN`: `DOUBLE` (The abscissa of the minimum found).
            *   `GOLDEN`: `DOUBLE` (The minimum function value at `XMIN`).
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Single-Variable Optimization:** Optimizing parameters in experiments or models where the objective function depends on only one variable (e.g., finding the optimal dosage of a drug, tuning a single PID controller gain).
        *   **Algorithm Development:** As a reliable, foundational minimization method for teaching or as a fallback for more complex, faster but potentially less robust algorithms.
        *   **Engineering Design:** Finding the optimal dimension for a component that minimizes a specific performance metric (e.g., weight, cost) under certain constraints.
    *   **Notes:** This method is highly robust and guaranteed to converge, but it is generally slower than methods like Brent's that combine it with parabolic interpolation.

*   **Brent's Method for Minimum Seeking**
    *   **Files:** `brent.pas`, `brent.txt`
    *   **Description:** Implements Brent's method, a robust and efficient algorithm for finding the minimum of a one-dimensional function. It intelligently combines the reliability of golden section search with the speed of parabolic interpolation, switching between them based on the function's behavior.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `BRENT` function isolates the minimum of `F(X)` to a fractional precision `TOL`, given a bracketing triplet `AX`, `BX`, `CX`. The function `F(X)` to be minimized must be defined within the program.
        *   **Function:** `BRENT(AX, BX, CX, TOL: DOUBLE; Var XMIN: DOUBLE): DOUBLE`
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `AX`, `BX`, `CX`: `DOUBLE` (The bracketing triplet of abscissas, similar to Golden Section Search).
            *   `TOL`: `DOUBLE` (The desired fractional precision for the minimum's location).
            *   `F(X): DOUBLE` (User-defined function to minimize).
        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `XMIN`: `DOUBLE` (The abscissa of the minimum found).

        *   **Machine Learning (Hyperparameter Tuning):** Optimizing a single hyperparameter (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength) by minimizing a validation error function.
        *   **Robotics:** Minimizing energy consumption for specific movements or tasks by finding the optimal value of a control variable.
    *   **Notes:** Generally considered one of the best one-dimensional minimization algorithms due to its excellent balance of speed and reliability. It also includes `ITMAX` (maximum iterations) and `ZEPS` (a small number to avoid precision issues for minimums near zero).

*   **Downhill Simplex Method (Nelder-Mead)**
    *   **Files:** `tamoeba.pas`, `tamoeba.txt`
    *   **Description:** Implements the downhill simplex method of Nelder and Mead for multidimensional minimization of a function `FUNC(X)`, where `X` is an `NDIM`-dimensional vector. This direct search method does not require derivatives, making it suitable for objective functions that are non-differentiable or difficult to differentiate. It operates by iteratively transforming a simplex (a geometric figure like a triangle in 2D or tetrahedron in 3D) to descend towards a minimum.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `AMOEBA` procedure finds the minimum of a multidimensional function given an initial simplex (set of `NDIM+1` vertices) and a convergence tolerance `FTOL`. The function `FUNC(P)` to be minimized must be defined within the program.
        *   **Procedure:** `AMOEBA(Var P: MAT; Var Y: VEC; MP, NP, NDIM: Integer; FTOL: Double; Var ITER: Integer)`
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `P`: `MAT` (Matrix whose `NDIM+1` rows are `NDIM`-dimensional vectors representing the vertices of the starting simplex. `MP` and `NP` are physical dimensions of `P`).
            *   `Y`: `VEC` (Vector of length `NDIM+1`, components pre-initialized to the values of `FUNC` evaluated at the vertices of `P`).
            *   `NDIM`: `INTEGER` (Number of dimensions/variables of the function).
            *   `FTOL`: `DOUBLE` (The fractional convergence tolerance to be achieved in the function value).
            *   `FUNC(P:VEC): Double` (User-defined function to minimize).
        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `P`, `Y`: Updated with points and function values near the minimum found.
            *   `ITER`: `INTEGER` (The number of iterations taken).
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Chemical Process Optimization:** Finding optimal reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, reactant concentrations, catalyst loading) without needing analytical derivatives.
        *   **Machine Learning:** Training simple models or optimizing hyperparameters in cases where gradient-based methods are not applicable or too complex (e.g., optimizing parameters of a complex simulation model).
        *   **Robotics:** Path planning or robot control where objective functions might be non-smooth or difficult to differentiate.
    *   **Notes:** This method is robust but can be slow to converge, especially for high-dimensional problems or functions with narrow valleys. It finds local minima and does not guarantee a global minimum.

*   **Powell's Method**
    *   **Files:** `tpowell.pas`, `tpowell.txt`
    *   **Description:** Implements Powell's method for minimizing a function of `N` variables. This derivative-free method constructs a set of conjugate directions, along which the function is minimized sequentially. It's often more efficient than the Nelder-Mead simplex for functions that are approximately quadratic.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `POWELL` procedure finds the minimum of a user-defined function `FUNC` given an initial starting point `P` and an initial matrix `XI` containing the search directions (usually the N unit vectors). The function `FUNC(P)` to be minimized must be defined within the program.
        *   **Procedure:** `POWELL(Var P: pVEC; XI: pMAT; N, NP: Integer; FTOL: Double; Var ITER: Integer; Var FRET: Double)`
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `P`: `pVEC` (pointer to `VEC` type, initial starting point vector).
            *   `XI`: `pMAT` (pointer to `MAT` type, initial matrix whose columns contain the search directions).
            *   `N`: `INTEGER` (number of variables).
            *   `NP`: `INTEGER` (physical dimension of `XI` for array declaration).
            *   `FTOL`: `DOUBLE` (the fractional tolerance in the function value for convergence).
            *   `FUNC(P:pVEC): Double` (User-defined function to minimize).
        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `P`: `pVEC` (updated to the best point found).
            *   `XI`: `pMAT` (the then-current direction set).
            *   `ITER`: `INTEGER` (the number of iterations taken).
            *   `FRET`: `DOUBLE` (the function value at the returned point `P`).
    *   **Dependencies:** Internally calls `LINMIN` (which uses `MNBRAK` and `BRENT`) for one-dimensional minimization along search directions.
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Structural Engineering:** Optimizing designs of structures (e.g., trusses, beams) where performance is a complex, multi-variable function, and derivatives might be computationally expensive.

        *   **Robotics:** Path planning for robotic arms with complex joint constraints, where objective functions might be non-differentiable.
    *   **Notes:** Generally more efficient than the downhill simplex method for higher dimensions, especially for quadratic-like functions, but can still get stuck in local minima.

*   **Steepest Descent Optimization (Partial Derivatives Required)**
    *   **Files:** `steepds.pas`, `steepds.txt`
    *   **Description:** Implements the steepest descent optimization method to find local maxima (or minima by optimizing `1/F(X)` or `-F(X)`) of an `L`-dimensional function. This version requires the user to provide analytical partial derivatives of the objective function within the `Eval` subroutine.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `Steepds` procedure finds the local optimum of an `L`-dimensional function. It requires initial estimates for parameters `X(I)`, an initial step size `XK`, an error criterion `E`, the number of variables `L`, and a maximum number of steps `M`. The `Eval` function must compute the objective function and populate a global array `D` with its partial derivatives.
        *   **Procedure:** `Steepds` (within `steepds.pas`)
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `X`: `Array` of `DOUBLE` (Initial values of variables `X[1]` to `X[L]`).
            *   `L`: `INTEGER` (The dimension of the function to study).
            *   `E`: `DOUBLE` (The convergence criterion).
            *   `M`: `INTEGER` (The maximum number of iterations).
            *   `XK`: `DOUBLE` (A starting constant for step size).
            *   `Eval`: Function (within `steepds.pas`) that computes `F(X)` and populates `D[i]` with partial derivatives `dF/dX[i]`.
        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `X`: `Array` of `DOUBLE` (The locally optimum set of parameters).
            *   `Eval` (after call): `DOUBLE` (The value of the local maximum/minimum found).
            *   `n`: `INTEGER` (The number of iterations performed).
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Theoretical Physics/Mathematics:** When explicit analytical forms of functions and their derivatives are known, this method is ideal for high-precision optimization.
        *   **Engineering Design Optimization:** Optimizing complex systems where mathematical models allow for analytical derivation of gradients, leading to more efficient searches for optimal designs (e.g., minimizing drag in aerodynamics, maximizing efficiency in power systems).
        *   **Economic Modeling:** Finding equilibrium points or maximizing utility functions in economic models where functional forms are well-defined and differentiable.
    *   **Notes:** Can achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence compared to using approximate derivatives, provided the derivatives are correct and smooth. However, it can be sensitive to the initial step size and may converge to a local optimum.

*   **Steepest Descent Optimization (Approximate Derivatives)**
    *   **Files:** `steepa.pas`, `steepda.txt`
    *   **Description:** Implements the steepest descent optimization method for finding local maxima (or minima by optimizing `1/F(X)` or `-F(X)`) of an `L`-dimensional function without requiring analytically supplied partial derivatives. Instead, derivatives are estimated numerically using finite difference approximations.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `Steepda` procedure finds the local optimum of an `L`-dimensional function by estimating partial derivatives numerically. It requires the same input parameters as `steepds.pas`, but the `Eval` function only needs to compute the objective function.
        *   **Procedure:** `Steepda` (within `steepa.pas`)
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `X`: `Array` of `DOUBLE` (Initial values of variables `X[1]` to `X[L]`).
            *   `L`: `INTEGER` (The dimension of the function to study).
            *   `E`: `DOUBLE` (The convergence criterion).
            *   `M`: `INTEGER` (The maximum number of iterations).
            *   `XK`: `DOUBLE` (A starting constant for step size).
            *   `Eval`: Function (within `steepa.pas`) that computes `F(X)`.
        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `X`: `Array` of `DOUBLE` (The locally optimum set of parameters).
            *   `Eval` (after call): `DOUBLE` (The value of the local maximum/minimum found).
            *   `n`: `INTEGER` (The number of iterations performed).
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Black-box Optimization:** Optimizing functions whose internal structure is unknown or too complex for analytical differentiation (e.g., optimizing parameters of a simulation model without access to its internal equations).
        *   **System Identification:** Estimating parameters of a system model by observing its input-output behavior, particularly when dealing with noisy or empirical data.
        *   **Reinforcement Learning (Policy Optimization):** In continuous action spaces, where gradients might be approximated from observed rewards, this method provides a foundational approach.
    *   **Notes:** More widely applicable than `steepds.pas` due to not needing analytical derivatives, but it can be less precise and potentially slower to converge, especially if the initial step size is too large or the function is noisy.

    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `ar_dlcomp` procedure computes `cm` coefficients for the composite series `(f o g)(x) = c0 + c1x + c2x^2 + ...`.
        *   **Procedure:** `ar_dlcomp(n: Integer; var t1: Table; var t2: Table; var res: Table)`
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `n`: `INTEGER` (The order of the development (maximum `SIZE`, which is 25)).
            *   `t1`: `Table` (Array of `Double`) (The coefficients of the limited development of `f(x)`).
            *   `t2`: `Table` (Array of `Double`) (The coefficients of the limited development of `g(x)`).
        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `res`: `Table` (The coefficients of the limited development of `f(g(x))`).
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Formal Power Series:** Computing series expansions of composite functions, often encountered in combinatorics, probability theory, and generating functions.
        *   **Mathematical Physics:** Analyzing coupled systems where one function's output feeds into another, requiring precise series expansions for their composition.
        *   **Nonlinear Control Systems:** Linearizing nonlinear systems around an operating point using Taylor series expansion of composite functions to apply linear control techniques.
    *   **Notes:** Requires that `b0 = 0` (i.e., `g(0) = 0`) for the composition `f(g(x))` to be well-defined at `x=0`. This is the most computationally intensive of the limited development routines but provides high accuracy.

### Other Utilities

This section covers additional mathematical utilities provided in the library, including special polynomial coefficient generation, and tools for user-defined function management and plotting.

*   **Laguerre Polynomial Coefficients**
    *   **Files:** `laguerre.pas`
    *   **Description:** Computes the coefficients of Laguerre polynomials `L_n(x)` using their recursion relation. Laguerre polynomials are orthogonal polynomials defined over the interval `[0, inf)` with a weighting function of `exp(-x)`.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `Laguerre_Coeff` procedure generates the `A(i)` coefficients for Laguerre polynomials of a specified order `n`.
        *   **Procedure:** `Laguerre_Coeff` (within `laguerre.pas`)
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `n`: `INTEGER` (The order of the polynomial for which to compute coefficients).
        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `A`: `Array` of `real_ar` (The coefficients of the Laguerre polynomial `L_n(x)`, where `A[i]` is the coefficient of `x^i`).
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Quantum Mechanics:** Solving the Schrödinger equation for systems like hydrogen-like atoms, where Laguerre polynomials appear as solutions to the radial wave equation.
        *   **Signal Processing:** Used as basis functions for spectral analysis or in orthogonal function expansions for signals defined over a semi-infinite interval.
        *   **Approximation Theory:** Used in generalized Fourier series expansions for functions over the interval `[0, inf)`.
    *   **Notes:** Laguerre polynomial coefficients are always integers, alternate in sign, and have a leading coefficient of `(-1)^n`. The program pre-computes `L0(x)` and `L1(x)` and then uses a recurrence relation for higher orders.

*   **Function Plotting and Evaluation**
    *   **Files:** `grfunct.pas`, `multifon.pas`, `ufunct.pas`, `type_def.pas`, `graph_2d.pas`, `crtgr2d.pas`
    *   **Description:** These programs provide capabilities for drawing 2D curves defined by their equations. `grfunct.pas` plots `y=f(x)` (Cartesian), while `multifon.pas` offers more versatile plotting, supporting Cartesian `y=f(x)`, polar `Rho=f(t)`, and parametric `x=FX(t), y=FY(t)` curves. They leverage the `UFunct` unit to compile and evaluate user-defined functions and `Graph_2d` (or `CrtGr2D`) for graphical rendering.
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** To visualize mathematical functions graphically from their symbolic equations.
        *   **`grfunct.pas` (Program `Test_Unit_Function`):**
            *   **Inputs:** User-defined function equation as a string (e.g., `"sin(x)/x"`), x-minimum and x-maximum values, and the number of points for plotting.
            *   **Outputs:** A graphical display of the `y=F(x)` function.
        *   **`multifon.pas` (Program `MULTIFUNC`):**
            *   **Inputs:** Prompts the user for the curve kind (1=Cartesian, 2=Polar, 3=Parametric), the function equation(s) (e.g., `Rho=f(t)` or `X=FX(t), Y=FY(t)`), and the interval/step size. Can automatically determine periods for periodic functions and maximum radii for proper scaling.
            *   **Outputs:** A graphical display of the selected 2D function type.
    *   **Dependencies:** Both plotting programs rely heavily on the `UFunct` unit for parsing and evaluating user-defined function strings. They also require `Type_def` for `REAL_AR` type and graphics units (`Graph_2d.pas` or `CrtGr2D.pas` for `multifon.pas`) for rendering.
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Data Visualization:** Plotting mathematical models, experimental data, or simulation outputs to understand their behavior and trends.
        *   **Engineering Design:** Visualizing geometries, performance curves, or stress distributions in a design process.
        *   **Education:** Demonstrating concepts in calculus, physics, geometry, and engineering by interactively plotting functions.
    *   **Notes:** `ufunct.pas` is essential for the functionality of these programs, allowing users to input arbitrary mathematical expressions.

*   **Function Simplification**
    *   **Files:** `simplif2.pas`, `ufunct.pas`
    *   **Description:** This unit provides a procedure to simplify the internal tree representation of a function (`FONC` type), particularly useful after symbolic derivation or other algebraic manipulations. It applies algebraic rules to reduce the complexity and improve the readability/efficiency of expressions (e.g., `0+u = u`, `1*u = u`, `-(-K) = K`, `CTE*CTE = CTE`).
    *   **Purpose & Usage:** The `SimplifyFunction` procedure simplifies a compiled function `f` by applying basic algebraic simplifications directly to its internal tree structure.
        *   **Procedure:** `SimplifyFunction(VAR f:FONC)`
        *   **Inputs:**
            *   `f`: `FONC` (The function to be simplified, typically obtained from `ufunct.pas`).
        *   **Outputs:**
            *   `f`: The modified `FONC` structure representing the simplified function.
    *   **Dependencies:** Requires the `UFunct` unit for the definition of the `FONC` type and other function manipulation utilities.
    *   **Real-world Applications:**
        *   **Symbolic Differentiation/Integration:** Reducing complex expressions resulting from symbolic calculus to their simplest forms, making them easier to interpret or use in further computations.
        *   **Equation Solving:** Simplifying equations before solving them to improve computational efficiency and reduce numerical errors.
        *   **Automated Theorem Proving:** As part of logic engines that manipulate mathematical expressions, ensuring expressions are canonical or in a reduced form.
    *   **Notes:** This unit works on the internal tree structure of the function, not directly on its string representation. It is often used in conjunction with formal derivative calculation (as seen in `deriv.pas`).
